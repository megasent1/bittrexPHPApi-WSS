# cloudflare-bypass
A static PHP library which allows you to bypass the CloudFlare UAM page (Under Attack Mode). 

This script works by converting the JavaScript challenge code into code understood by the PHP compiling engine. 

Example usage can be found in run.php

EDIT: I've been really busy lately and therefore accept my apology for not replying to these issues. I will eventually get around to fixing them, and in the pipeline I also have a plan in place to rewrite the script to make it more flexible for implementation into big scale projects. I just haven't had the time to even look at my Github account since its being consumed by work at the moment.
